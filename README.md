## Reference
I used [JSON server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for the backend part of the project for now. 

## Future Improvement
Definitely will update the styling and more functionalities such as comment and upvote/downvote. Stay tune...

##### (I do not plan to deploy the website until I learn more about the backend part of the web development.)

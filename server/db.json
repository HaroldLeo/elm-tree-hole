      "article": "as far as im concerned, webdev is really not that friendly to beginners, especially with elm. i believe that elm is for experienced web developers who want to try out some new stuff that might not lead to numerous runtime exceptions. As a result, the documentation isnt really helpful for absolute beginners. \n\nhowever, after playing around with elm for the last few weeks, the MVC in elm is actually well-structured and fairly easy to understand. However, what is really frustrating is the messiness in html and css, which becomes a nightmare when i went back and add a thousand more divs to make the website somewhat lookable in css. i just hope that some day a new language and replace all of them and the world will become peaceful again.
